INSTALL

  Mdview uses GTK+ libraries (Version 1.2.0 or later).
  Before installation of mdview, check the version of GTK+, e.g.:

    gtk-config --version

  To build mdview, type these commands in this directory:

    ./configure
    make

  The former creates the Makefile, the latter builds mdview.
  If your 'make' command is not GNU make, use GNU make, for example:

    gmake

  To install mdview to /usr/local directory, type this command:

    make install

  If you want to uninstall mdview, type this command:

    make uninstall

  If you need to install other directories, use '--prefix=/directory'
  option of the configure script. You can see other options by the
  command:

    ./configure --help

  If you want to use gtk12-config instead of gtk-config, try them:

    setenv GTK_CONFIG gtk12-config
    ./configure
    make
